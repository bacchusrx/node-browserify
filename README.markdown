Fake browserify, yo.
====================

The purpose of this fork is to test some hacks to browserify to make it easier
to embed multi-file CommonJS modules within Node itself. This is perhaps a
peculiar requirement of a project I'm working on, so I'm not sure it'll be
terribly useful to people who need browserify for its intended purpose.

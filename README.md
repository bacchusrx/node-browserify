embedify.
=========

This is an experimental fork of substack's browserify. Its purpose is to make
it easier to embed multifile NPM/CommonJS modules within Node itself. This is
perhaps a peculiar requirement of a project I'm working on, so I'm not sure
it'll be terribly useful to people who need browserify for its intended
purpose.
